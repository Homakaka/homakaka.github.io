## About Me

{{< figure src="/images/profile.png" width="300" alt="My Profile Image" class="left" >}}

I am currently a visiting researcher/scholar at The University of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor Mattan Erez.

Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University ([SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/)), advised by Professor Jung Ho Ahn.
Before I joined the [SCALE laboratory](https://scale.snu.ac.kr) for my Ph.D., I completed my BSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering at SNU.

My research focus is on computer architecture, memory system/management, and system reliability and security.
Recently, I have been focusing on memory system security, particularly related to the DRAM devices (e.g., read disturbance errors such as rowhammer/rowpress and covert-/side-channels) and reverse-engineering the operations of commercial processors' memory controllers.
Also, I'm interested in enhancing system reliability against silient data corruptions (SDCs).
